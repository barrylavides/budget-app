## Prerequisites

Before starting any tickets:

1. **Docker Desktop** — required for all containers (agents + Supabase)
2. **Claude Code** — installed and authenticated
3. **TDD skill** — install to `~/.claude/skills/tdd/`
4. **CLAUDE.md** — run `/init` in the project root to generate

No Supabase CLI on the host — it runs inside a Docker container with the Docker socket mounted.

---

## Ticket Execution Order

```
Phase 1 — Foundation (sequential, one at a time)
  #2  Project scaffold + local Supabase + schema    [HITL] [sonnet]
  #3  Month sidebar + create month                          [haiku]
  #4  Sources panel with balance tracking                   [haiku]
  #5  Expenses + category views                             [haiku]

Phase 2 — Features (parallel — 3 agents simultaneously)
  #6  Half views + overview dashboard               [feat/half-views]  [sonnet]
  #7  Payments + status tracking                    [feat/payments]    [sonnet]
  #8  Recurring expense templates                   [feat/recurring]   [haiku]

Phase 3 — Finish (sequential)
  #9  Statistics view                               [after #7 merges]  [haiku]
  #10 Polish + general UX                           [after #6-#9]      [sonnet]
  #11 Auth + Cloud Supabase + Vercel deploy         [HITL]             [sonnet]
```

**Model key:**
- `[sonnet]` = `claude-sonnet-4-6` — complex scaffolding, multi-component features, cross-cutting changes, infra/auth
- `[haiku]` = `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — single-feature CRUD where patterns are already established by earlier tickets

---

## Infrastructure Model

Every ticket gets a fresh, isolated environment: one agent container that starts its own Supabase instance. The agent container has the Supabase CLI installed and mounts `/var/run/docker.sock`, so it can spin up Supabase service containers as siblings on the host Docker daemon. After the ticket is done and pushed, everything is torn down. The next ticket starts clean.

**Resource usage:**
- Sequential: ~2GB RAM (1 Supabase + 1 agent)
- Parallel: ~6GB RAM (3 Supabase + 3 agents). Requires 16GB+ Mac.

## Agent Docker Setup

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  git \
  curl \
  docker.io \
  gosu \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# GitHub CLI
RUN curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
  | dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
  && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" \
  | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
  && apt-get update && apt-get install -y gh

# Supabase CLI
RUN ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture) && \
  VERSION=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/supabase/cli/releases/latest | sed -n 's/.*"tag_name":"v\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p') && \
  curl -fsSL "https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases/download/v${VERSION}/supabase_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.deb" -o /tmp/supabase.deb && \
  dpkg -i /tmp/supabase.deb && \
  rm /tmp/supabase.deb

# Claude Code (global install + manual postinstall for native binary)
RUN bun install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code \
  && CLAUDE_PKG=$(find /root -path "*/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/install.cjs" 2>/dev/null | head -1) \
  && if [ -n "$CLAUDE_PKG" ]; then bun "$CLAUDE_PKG"; fi

# Wrap supabase to always exclude studio on start (Studio bind-mounts fail in sibling containers)
RUN mv /usr/bin/supabase /usr/bin/supabase-real \
  && printf '#!/bin/bash\nif [ "$1" = "start" ]; then\n  shift\n  exec /usr/bin/supabase-real start --exclude studio "$@"\nfi\nexec /usr/bin/supabase-real "$@"\n' > /usr/bin/supabase \
  && chmod +x /usr/bin/supabase

# Make claude accessible to all users
RUN chmod a+rx /root && chmod -R a+rX /root/.bun \
  && CLAUDE_BIN=$(find /root/.bun -name "claude" -path "*/claude-code-linux-*/claude" ! -path "*musl*" | head -1) \
  && ln -sf "$CLAUDE_BIN" /usr/local/bin/claude

# Non-root user (Claude Code blocks --dangerously-skip-permissions as root)
RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash agent \
  && mkdir -p /home/agent/app \
  && chown agent:agent /home/agent/app

COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh

WORKDIR /home/agent/app

ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["bash"]
```

The entrypoint runs as root to `chmod 666` the Docker socket (the docker group trick doesn't work on Docker Desktop for Mac), then drops to the `agent` user via `gosu`.

`docker.io` is needed so the Supabase CLI inside the container can talk to the Docker daemon via the mounted socket.

### Build gotchas

Issues hit during the first build and how they were resolved:

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `gpg: not found` when installing Supabase CLI via apt repo | `oven/bun` image doesn't include `gpg`, and `deb.supabase.com` doesn't resolve | Install via GitHub release `.deb` instead of apt repo |
| `npm: not found` when installing Claude Code | `oven/bun` image ships bun, not npm | Use `bun install -g` instead of `npm install -g` |
| `claude native binary not installed` | `bun install -g` doesn't run postinstall scripts needed for the platform-native binary | Run `install.cjs` manually after `bun install -g`: find the file and execute with `bun` |
| `failed to connect to postgres: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:54322: connection refused` | Supabase containers publish ports to the Docker VM's network; agent container has its own network namespace | Add `--network host` to `docker run` so agent shares the VM's network |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions cannot be used with root/sudo privileges` | Container runs as root by default; Claude Code blocks skip-permissions for root | Add non-root `agent` user; entrypoint drops to it via `gosu` |
| `permission denied` on Docker socket as non-root | Docker Desktop for Mac doesn't use a `docker` group; socket is owned by root | Entrypoint runs as root, `chmod 666` the socket, then `gosu agent` |
| `claude: command not found` as non-root | `bun install -g` puts binaries in `/root/.bun/bin/`, not on the `agent` user's PATH | Symlink `claude` and `bun` to `/usr/local/bin/` |
| `mounts denied: /app/supabase/snippets is not shared from the host` | Supabase Studio bind-mounts a container-internal path into a sibling container; Docker Desktop can't see it | Wrap `supabase` binary so `start` always injects `--exclude studio` (can't rely on the LLM to remember the flag) |
| `Claude configuration file not found at: /root/.claude.json` | `.claude.json` lives at home root, not inside `.claude/`; wasn't being mounted | Mount `$HOME/.claude.json` into the container alongside `$HOME/.claude/` |
| 404 downloading Supabase `.deb` | Release asset filename includes the version number (e.g. `supabase_2.101.0_linux_arm64.deb`), not a generic `supabase_linux_arm64.deb` | Fetch version from GitHub API first, then build the URL dynamically |

### Build the image (one time)

```bash
docker build -t budget-agent .
```

---

## Convenience Script

`run-ticket.sh` in the project root. Two layers of error recovery:

1. **In-session resilience** — the prompt tells the agent to diagnose and retry failed commands (up to 3 times per command) instead of giving up on the first error
2. **Capped retry wrapper** — if the `claude` process itself crashes, the script restarts it (max 3 attempts), passing the last 80 lines of output so the next attempt can diagnose and continue where the previous one left off

### Why not Ralph Wiggum?

The [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) runs the agent in an infinite loop — if it fails, feed the error back and retry forever. We use a capped variant instead because:

- **Fresh context per retry** — each restart is a new `claude -p` invocation with no memory of prior work. An infinite loop can redo or undo completed work on every iteration.
- **Token cost** — each retry pays for a full clone + prompt. Uncapped retries can burn through budget on a fundamentally broken environment (bad Dockerfile, missing credentials).
- **Unfixable errors exist** — wrong architecture, expired tokens, Docker daemon down. An infinite loop spins forever; a capped loop fails fast and tells you to look.

The first layer (in-session resilience) handles 90% of transient errors without any retry cost. The second layer (capped at 3) catches the remaining cases where the process itself dies.

### Usage

```bash
./run-ticket.sh <issue#> <branch-name> <model> [effort]

# Phase 1 — sequential
./run-ticket.sh 2 scaffold sonnet
./run-ticket.sh 3 month-sidebar haiku
./run-ticket.sh 4 sources-panel haiku
./run-ticket.sh 5 expenses haiku

# Phase 2 — parallel (3 terminals)
./run-ticket.sh 6 half-views sonnet
./run-ticket.sh 7 payments sonnet
./run-ticket.sh 8 recurring haiku

# With effort override
./run-ticket.sh 3 month-sidebar haiku low
```

## Issue #2 Execution — Problems & Solutions

Getting the first ticket (#2 — scaffold) to complete its full acceptance criteria surfaced a string of issues across authentication, persistence, agent behavior, and verification. Each was fixed in `run-ticket.sh`, the prompt, or the Dockerfile. Recorded here so later tickets don't re-hit them.

| # | Problem | Symptom | Root cause | Solution |
|---|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Agent not authenticated | `Not logged in · Please run /login` on every attempt | Container only received `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, but the host authenticates via OAuth (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) | Pass `-e CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to `docker run` alongside the API key |
| 2 | Work vanished after run | Agent reported success, but no branch/commits existed anywhere | `--rm` container discarded its filesystem on exit; the in-container clone (and its commits) went with it | Mount a persistent host workspace `workspaces/ticket-<N>` into the container; reuse it on retries instead of re-cloning |
| 3 | Agent never pushed | Output ended with "Approve this commit message?" then stopped | Agent treated the headless run as interactive and waited for confirmation | Added **CRITICAL RULES** to the prompt (non-interactive — commit directly, push immediately, never ask) **and** a host-side commit+push fallback after the run |
| 4 | Risk of pushing broken work | — | Host-side fallback pushed regardless of outcome | Moved the commit/push fallback inside the `EXIT_CODE == 0` (success-only) branch |
| 5 | Bare scaffold, ACs unmet | App showed unstyled "Loading…"; no theme, shell, routes, seed, or engine | Prompt said only "implement using /tdd"; agent ran `create vite` and called it done | Rewrote prompt with a **quality bar**: read every acceptance-criteria checkbox, implement them one by one, self-check the full list before committing |
| 6 | App built but didn't render | Unit tests passed, but browser threw `Failed to resolve import "@/components/layout/Shell"` | Unit tests never exercised the real Vite build / import resolution | Added a **Playwright smoke-test** step: start the dev server, load the app, assert no console errors and that key elements render — fixes import/build failures before commit |
| 7 | Playwright unusable in container | `playwright install --with-deps` needs `apt` (root); browser cache landed in `/root` unreadable by the `agent` user | Container drops to non-root `agent`; per-user browser cache isn't shared | Install Chromium + system deps in the **Dockerfile** as root; set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/playwright-browsers` (world-readable); tell the agent **not** to run `playwright install` |
| 8 | Push rejected | `! [rejected] feat/scaffold -> feat/scaffold (non-fast-forward)`; agent misreported it as "OAuth token invalid" | Each run regenerates the branch with fresh history; a stale `feat/scaffold` from a prior run had diverged | Host-side fallback push uses `--force-with-lease` (each run is a complete reimplementation on a dedicated branch) |
| 9 | Wrong "run locally" hint | `cd: no such file or directory: app` | Script hardcoded `cd app`, but the agent scaffolds into `family-budget/` | Auto-detect the app dir by finding the nearest `package.json` (excluding `node_modules`) |

### Script enhancements that came out of this

- **Persistent workspaces** — each ticket clones into `workspaces/ticket-<N>/` on the host (gitignored), surviving container teardown and reused across retries.
- **Live logs + live timer** — docker output streams in real time, every line prefixed with `[HH:MM:SS]` elapsed; a background heartbeat ticks the timer every 10s during idle (agent-thinking) stretches.
- **Clear attempt framing** — each attempt is wrapped in divider blocks with start time, and a pass/fail footer showing per-attempt and total elapsed time.
- **Success-only commit/push** — host-side safety net commits any leftover changes and force-pushes the branch, but only when the agent exits 0.
- **Run-locally hint** — on success, prints the exact `cd <detected-app-dir> && bun install && bun run dev` to launch the result.

---

## Running Agents — Sequential Tickets

Each sequential ticket follows this cycle: launch agent → agent starts Supabase + implements ticket → tear down → repeat.

### Step 1 — Run the agent

**Option A — Convenience script** (recommended):

```bash
./run-ticket.sh <issue#> <branch-name> <model>
# Example: ./run-ticket.sh 2 scaffold sonnet
```

See the model key in [Ticket Execution Order](#ticket-execution-order) for each ticket's recommended model.

**Option B — Manual docker run**:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $HOME/.claude:/home/agent/.claude \
  -v $HOME/.claude.json:/home/agent/.claude.json \
  -v $HOME/.config/gh:/home/agent/.config/gh \
  budget-agent \
  bash -c "git clone https://github.com/barrylavides/budget-app.git . && claude --model <MODEL_ID> -p \"$(cat <<'PROMPT'
You are implementing a ticket for the FamilyBudget app.

1. Run `supabase start --exclude studio` in the project root to start the local Supabase instance
2. Note the anon key and API URL from the output
3. Read the issue: gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --repo barrylavides/budget-app
4. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
5. Read the PRD: gh issue view 1 --repo barrylavides/budget-app
6. Create and switch to branch: feat/<branch-name>
7. Implement using /tdd (red-green-refactor loop)
8. Use the API URL and anon key from step 2 for Supabase connections
9. Run all tests: bun run test
10. Commit and push when all tests pass
11. Run `supabase stop` to shut down the local instance

Branch: feat/<branch-name>
Issue: #<ISSUE_NUMBER>
PROMPT
)\" --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

The agent container has the Supabase CLI and Docker CLI installed, and the host's Docker socket is mounted (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`). When the agent runs `supabase start`, the CLI talks to Docker Desktop through that socket, which creates the Supabase containers (Postgres, API, Studio) as siblings — not nested inside the agent container:

```
Docker Desktop (host)
├── agent container        ← you started this
│   └── supabase start     ← talks to socket
├── supabase-db            ← Docker Desktop created these
├── supabase-api              because the socket request
├── supabase-studio           came through
```

### Step 2 — Merge on host, repeat

```bash
cd /Users/barry/Documents/projects/budget-app
git fetch origin
git merge origin/feat/<branch-name>
bun run test  # verify locally if you want
git push origin main
```

Then start from Step 1 for the next ticket.

---

## Running Agents — Parallel Tickets

After ticket #5 is merged to `main`, run all 3 in separate terminals. Each gets its own Supabase on different ports.

### Launch 3 agents (3 terminals)

Each agent starts its own Supabase instance, implements the ticket, and shuts Supabase down. Run the convenience script in 3 separate terminals — see [Convenience Script](#convenience-script) for the commands.

Each agent's `supabase start` will allocate its own ports automatically since they run in separate cloned repos inside separate containers.

> ⚠️ **The agent phase is isolated; the post-agent verification gate is NOT.** After an agent pushes, `run-ticket.sh` re-runs the acceptance suite on the **host** (`run_host_gates`), and that gate uses the single shared host stack — see [Parallel Gate Isolation](#parallel-gate-isolation) for why and how it's serialized today.

---

## Parallel Gate Isolation

After an agent finishes, `run-ticket.sh` re-verifies the pushed branch on the host (`run_host_gates`): `supabase db reset` + `bunx playwright test`. Every workspace ships the **same** `supabase/config.toml` (`project_id = "project"`, fixed ports `54321`/`54322`) and Playwright targets a fixed Vite port (`5173`, `reuseExistingServer: true`). So unlike the in-container agent phase, **all host gates share one database and one dev server.**

Running `./run-ticket.sh` for several tickets in parallel therefore lets their gates clobber each other: one gate's `db reset` reseeds the DB while another gate's tests are mid-assertion, and Playwright runs reuse whichever dev server bound `5173` first. This surfaces as *bogus* failures — values that the clean seed can't produce (e.g. half-1 income reading ₱90k instead of ₱85k, a source balance off by one payment, a toast that never renders). The feature code is fine; the environment was contaminated.

There is a second, related race **inside a single gate**: Playwright's default parallel workers run multiple spec files at once against that one DB, and several AC specs mutate global rows or depend on ordering (e.g. an `on delete set null` FK nulling a seeded payment when a "delete source" test runs, shared month fixtures, recurring-template CRUD). So even one gate can flake.

### Current fix — Option A: serialize (implemented)

`run_host_gates` now:

1. **Serializes across parallel runs** with a portable `mkdir` lock (`$TMPDIR/budget-app-gate.lock`; macOS has no `flock`). The lock is held only around the DB-touching region (from `supabase db reset` through Playwright) and released on every exit path; a stale-PID guard reclaims it if a holder dies. Siblings print `⏳ [gate] shared local stack busy — waiting…` and take turns.
2. **Forces serial tests** with `bunx playwright test --workers=1`, eliminating the intra-suite shared-DB race.

The expensive work — the agent implementing the ticket in its own container — still runs **fully in parallel**. Only the ~30s host gates take turns, so the wall-clock cost is negligible. This is correct and tiny (~5 lines), at the price of gates not overlapping.

### Long-term — Option B: true per-ticket stacks (not yet implemented)

The durable alternative is to give each ticket its **own** Supabase stack so gates can run genuinely in parallel. This should become **config-driven**: before `supabase start`, stamp each workspace's `config.toml` with a unique identity derived from the ticket number, and point Playwright at a matching Vite port — e.g.

```toml
# workspaces/ticket-<N>/family-budget/supabase/config.toml
project_id = "ticket-<N>"
[api]  port = 54321 + N*100
[db]   port = 54322 + N*100
# + Playwright webServer.port / baseURL = 5173 + N
```

`run_host_gates` would then drop the lock (stacks no longer collide) but **keep `--workers=1`** (per-ticket stacks don't fix the intra-suite race). Cost: ~6 GB+ RAM for 3 concurrent stacks (16 GB+ Mac), plus port arithmetic, per-stack teardown, and `.env.local` wiring — which is why it's deferred. **For now we run Option A; Option B is the planned upgrade when parallel gate throughput matters.**

---

## Merging Parallel Branches

After all 3 parallel agents finish, merge one at a time:

```bash
cd /Users/barry/Documents/projects/budget-app

# 1. Merge payments first (statistics ticket depends on it)
git fetch origin
git merge origin/feat/payments
bun run test

# 2. Merge half-views
git merge origin/feat/half-views
bun run test  # fix conflicts if any

# 3. Merge recurring
git merge origin/feat/recurring
bun run test  # fix conflicts if any

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Merge conflict risk

| Pair     | Risk     | Reason                                          |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| #6 vs #7 | **Low**  | Different UI components, different budget-engine functions |
| #6 vs #8 | **None** | Completely separate pages and data               |
| #7 vs #8 | **Low**  | #8 touches month creation, #7 touches expenses   |

If conflicts arise, they should be minor (import lists, router config). Resolve and re-run tests.
